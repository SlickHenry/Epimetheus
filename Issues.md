## 🚨 Critical Issues (Fix First)

These issues can cause data loss, system hangs, or other serious problems in production.

### Issue #1: Event Loss During Syslog Failures ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
- **Impact**: Events marked as processed before successful forwarding
- **Risk**: Data loss if syslog server is unavailable
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Event marking now happens AFTER successful syslog write
- **Resolved**: 2025-08-26

```go
// Fixed code:
if err := syslogWriter.Write(syslogMessage); err != nil {
    // Handle failure, event NOT marked as processed
    continue
}
// Mark as processed AFTER successful forwarding ✅
if eventCache != nil {
    eventCache.MarkProcessed(eventKey)
}
```

**Resolution**: Moved event marking to AFTER successful syslog write, preventing data loss.

### Issue #2: Compartment Loading Infinite Recursion ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** 
- **Impact**: System can hang indefinitely on compartment cycles
- **Risk**: Service unavailable, requires manual restart
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Added cycle detection with visited compartment tracking
- **Resolved**: 2025-08-26

```go
// Fixed code with cycle detection:
func loadSubCompartmentsWithVisited(compartmentID string, config *Configuration, visited map[string]bool) error {
    if visited[compartmentID] {
        log.Printf("⚠️  Compartment cycle detected, skipping %s", compartmentID)
        return nil // Prevents infinite recursion ✅
    }
    visited[compartmentID] = true
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Resolution**: Implemented visited compartment tracking to detect and prevent infinite recursion cycles.

### Issue #3: Rate Limiting Never Applied ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**
- **Impact**: Rate limiting configuration was completely bypassed for CloudGuard events
- **Risk**: Excessive event processing, potential API throttling
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Rate limiting now applies to ALL event types including CloudGuard
- **Resolved**: 2025-08-26

```go
// Fixed: Rate limiting now applied to all events
if !passesRateLimit(eventType, filter.RateLimiting) {
    return false  // ✅ All events respect rate limits
}

// High-risk CloudGuard events still get preference but must pass rate limiting
if isHighRisk {
    if !passesRateLimit(eventType, filter.RateLimiting) {
        return false  // ✅ Even critical events respect rate limits
    }
    return true
}
```

**Resolution**: Fixed filtering logic to ensure rate limiting is applied to all event types, including high-risk CloudGuard events. Priority events and high-risk events still get preferential processing but must respect configured rate limits.

### Issue #4: OCI Logging Service Configuration Dependency ⚠️ **ACTIVE**
- **Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
- **Impact**: VCN Flow Logs and other logging services require upstream OCI configuration to be discoverable
- **Risk**: Empty results from logging API despite functional implementation
- **Status**: ⚠️ **CONFIGURATION REQUIRED** - Many logging access options REQUIRE OCI configurations to send logs to make them available
- **Identified**: 2025-08-27

**Root Cause**: 
The OCI Logging service API can only return logs that have been explicitly configured to be sent to the logging service. Many OCI services (VCN Flow Logs, Load Balancer logs, WAF logs, etc.) do not automatically send their logs to the OCI Logging service - this must be manually configured per resource.

**Key Requirements**:
1. **VCN Flow Logs**: Must enable VCN Flow Log collection in OCI Console → Networking → Virtual Cloud Networks → [VCN] → Flow Logs
2. **Load Balancer Logs**: Must configure access/error log destinations in Load Balancer settings  
3. **WAF Logs**: Must enable WAF logging and configure log destination
4. **Object Storage Logs**: Must enable request logging on buckets
5. **API Gateway Logs**: Must configure execution and access logging

**Impact Assessment**:
- ✅ **Implementation Complete**: Epimetheus can discover and collect from any logs available in OCI Logging service
- ❌ **Configuration Gap**: Most OCI resources do not send logs to OCI Logging service by default
- 🔧 **Action Required**: Users must configure upstream OCI services to enable log collection

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Document OCI service configuration requirements for each log type
- [ ] Provide step-by-step guides for enabling VCN Flow Logs, Load Balancer logs, etc.
- [ ] Add configuration validation warnings when logging endpoint returns no results
- [ ] Consider alternative collection methods for unconfigured services

## 🟠 High Priority Issues

These issues affect reliability and user experience but don't cause immediate data loss.

### Issue #5: Statistics Mixing Event Cache and Lookup Cache ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**
- **Impact**: Confusing and inaccurate performance metrics
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Separated event cache and lookup cache statistics 
- **Resolved**: 2025-08-26

**Resolution**: 
- Separated `ServiceStats` into distinct `EventCacheHits/Misses` and `LookupCacheHits/Misses` fields
- Updated health endpoint and metrics to provide clear, separate statistics
- Enhanced logging to distinguish between event cache effectiveness and lookup cache performance

### Issue #6: Poor Compartment Error Handling ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**
- **Impact**: Silent failures when compartments are inaccessible
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Added proper error tracking and reporting for compartment failures
- **Resolved**: 2025-08-26

**Resolution**:
- Added `CompartmentErrors` counter to `ServiceStats` for monitoring compartment access failures
- Enhanced error logging with compartment names and IDs for better troubleshooting
- Compartment failures are now tracked and exposed via health endpoint and metrics
- Improved visibility into compartment-related issues without silent failures

### Issue #7: Incomplete Service Account Detection ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**
- **Impact**: Service account filtering unreliable
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Enhanced service account detection with comprehensive pattern matching
- **Resolved**: 2025-08-26

**Resolution**:
- Expanded `isServiceAccount()` function to detect multiple OCI service account types:
  - Auth types: `natv`, `InstancePrincipal`, `ResourcePrincipal`
  - Principal types: `instance`, `resource`, service-related types  
  - Principal name patterns: `instanceprincipal`, `service_account`, `system_user`, etc.
  - OCID patterns: `ocid1.instance.*`, `ocid1.dynamicgroup.*`, `ocid1.fnfunc.*`
  - Service source patterns: core services, with console/CLI exclusions for user activity
- Significantly improved reliability of service account filtering in audit events

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

These issues affect functionality and user experience but have workarounds.

### Issue #8: Statistics Configuration Unused ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- **Impact**: Configuration options defined but not implemented
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - All statistics configuration options now functional
- **Resolved**: 2025-08-26

**Resolution**:
- Implemented `LogIntervalEvents` - periodic detailed logging every N events when `EnableDetailedLogging` is true
- Implemented `TrackCacheMetrics` - conditional cache statistics tracking 
- Implemented `TrackPerformanceMetrics` - conditional performance metrics (events/sec, poll duration)
- Added `EventsSinceLastLog` and `LastPeriodicLog` tracking to ServiceStats
- Statistics configuration now controls what metrics are collected and logged

### Issue #9: Weak Configuration Validation ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- **Impact**: Invalid configurations not caught until runtime
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Comprehensive validation catches invalid configs early
- **Resolved**: 2025-08-26

**Resolution**:
- Enhanced `validateConfig()` with comprehensive checks:
  - Syslog protocol validation (tcp/udp only)
  - Fetch interval bounds (10-3600 seconds)
  - Compartment mode validation (all/tenancy_only/include/exclude)
  - Required compartment IDs for include/exclude modes
  - Retry configuration bounds (0-10 retries, 1-60s delay)
  - Cache configuration limits (size, window duration)
  - API services validation (names, URLs, versions, intervals)
  - Private key file existence check
  - Region format validation
- Invalid configurations now fail fast with clear error messages

### Issue #10: Health Checks Don't Validate Actual Health ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- **Impact**: False positives in monitoring systems
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Health checks now validate actual system health
- **Resolved**: 2025-08-26

**Resolution**:
- **Smart Health Status**: Returns `healthy`, `degraded`, or `unhealthy` based on actual metrics
- **Health Issues Array**: Lists specific problems detected (e.g., `no_recent_api_activity`, `high_api_failure_rate`)
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Returns 503 for unhealthy, 200 for healthy/degraded
- **Multiple Health Checks**:
  - API activity (degraded if >2h since last run)
  - API failure rates (degraded >25%, unhealthy >50%)
  - Syslog reconnect frequency (degraded >10 reconnects)
  - Compartment errors (degraded >5 errors)
  - Recent error timeframes (unhealthy if <5min, degraded if <30min)
  - Event processing activity (degraded if no events after 1h)
- **Prometheus Health Metric**: `oci_audit_forwarder_health_status` (1.0=healthy, 0.5=degraded, 0.0=unhealthy)
- **Enhanced Metrics**: API failure rate, time since last run, compartment error count
