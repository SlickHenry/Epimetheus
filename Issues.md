## 🚨 Critical Issues (Fix First)

These issues can cause data loss, system hangs, or other serious problems in production.

### Issue #1: Event Loss During Syslog Failures
- **Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
- **Impact**: Events marked as processed before successful forwarding
- **Risk**: Data loss if syslog server is unavailable
- **Status**: 🔍 **IDENTIFIED** - Fix in progress
- **ETA**: (Next availability for patching)

```go
// Current problematic code:
eventCache.MarkProcessed(eventKey) // ❌ BEFORE syslog write
if err := syslogWriter.Write(syslogMessage); err != nil {
    // Event already marked as processed - LOST!
}
```

**Fix Plan**: Move event marking to AFTER successful syslog write.

### Issue #2: Compartment Loading Infinite Recursion
- **Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** 
- **Impact**: System can hang indefinitely on compartment cycles
- **Risk**: Service unavailable, requires manual restart
- **Status**: 🔍 **IDENTIFIED** - Fix in progress
- **ETA**: (Next availability for patching)

**Fix Plan**: Add cycle detection and visited compartment tracking.

### Issue #3: Rate Limiting Never Applied
- **Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**
- **Impact**: Rate limiting configuration is ignored
- **Risk**: Excessive event processing, potential API throttling
- **Status**: 🔍 **IDENTIFIED** - Fix ready
- **ETA**: (Next availability for patching)

**Fix Plan**: Reorder filtering logic to apply rate limiting correctly.

## 🟠 High Priority Issues

These issues affect reliability and user experience but don't cause immediate data loss.

### Issue #4: Statistics Mixing Event Cache and Lookup Cache
- **Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**
- **Impact**: Confusing and inaccurate performance metrics
- **Status**: 🔍 **IDENTIFIED**
- **ETA**: (Next availability for patching)

### Issue #5: Poor Compartment Error Handling
- **Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**
- **Impact**: Silent failures when compartments are inaccessible
- **Status**: 🔍 **IDENTIFIED**
- **ETA**: (Next availability for patching)

### Issue #6: Incomplete Service Account Detection
- **Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**
- **Impact**: Service account filtering unreliable
- **Status**: 🔍 **IDENTIFIED**
- **ETA**: (Next availability for patching)

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

These issues affect functionality and user experience but have workarounds.

### Issue #7: Statistics Configuration Unused
- **Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- **Impact**: Configuration options defined but not implemented
- **Status**: 🔍 **IDENTIFIED**
- **ETA**: (Next availability for patching)

### Issue #8: Weak Configuration Validation
- **Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- **Impact**: Invalid configurations not caught until runtime
- **Status**: 🔍 **IDENTIFIED**
- **ETA**: (Next availability for patching)

### Issue #9: Health Checks Don't Validate Actual Health
- **Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- **Impact**: False positives in monitoring systems
- **Status**: 🔍 **IDENTIFIED**
- **ETA**: (Next availability for patching)
